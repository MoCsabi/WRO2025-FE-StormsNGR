# Introduction
We are the StormsNGR team from Hungary, and we are competing in the 2025 WRO Future Engineers category. This is our second year competing after a very successful first year, for which you can find our documentation [here](https://github.com/MoCsabi/WRO2024-FE-StormsNGR). We will be keeping that repository as it is, and will be updating this repository for the 2025 season.

# Abstract
Our solution is an autonomous car powered by a Raspberry Pi coded in Python, responsible for the main challenge logic, and an ESP microcontroller coded in C, responsible for controlling the motors and processing sensor data. The two devices communicate using UART. We use a 360° 2D LiDAR combined with a gyro to always know where the robot is on the mat. Detection of the traffic sign's color is done by combining the output of the LiDAR with the camera feed to know exactly where the object is. We use ackermann steering geometry calibrated so the car can leave the parking space in one continuous arc. Driving is powered by 1 DC motor through a differential gearbox designed from scratch, with a top speed of around 2.6 m/s.

# Special thanks
Special thanks to Zsolt Molnár for all the mentoring he's done for us, József Molnár from the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/) Faculty of Mechanical Engineering for helping us with the preparations, György Fenyvesi for helping us develop our prototype [custom made interconnect panel](/schemes/README.md/#custom-made-interconnect-panel-wiring-with-connections-labeled), József Gräff, our coach Zsolt Molnár and a bunch of others for helping us by reviewing all the documentation. And of course, to both our families for tolerating us taking up the entire living room with the robot mat 🙂.
