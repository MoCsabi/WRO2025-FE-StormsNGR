# Introduction
We are the StormsNGR team from Hungary, and we are competing in the 2025 WRO Future Engineers category. This is our second year competing after a very successful first year, for which you can find our documentation [here](https://github.com/MoCsabi/WRO2024-FE-StormsNGR). We will be keeping that repository as it is, and will be updating this repository for the 2025 season.
